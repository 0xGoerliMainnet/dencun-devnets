# 4844-testnet

**TODO** This repository is still a work in progress and will contain the infrastructure code to run 4844 testnets.

## Version management for tools

We're using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to make sure that we all use the same versions across tools. Our repositories should contain versions defined in .tools-versions.

You can then use [`./asdf-setup.sh`](./asdf-setup.sh) to install all dependencies.
